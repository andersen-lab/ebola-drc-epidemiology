#### Summary

In an effort to increase our understanding of the current Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we are compiling epidemiological data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO).

We accumulate patient data from situation reports released by the WHO each week, which provide the cumulative number of Ebola patients from the beginning of the outbreak. The data is presented in the situation reports in tables and classified by case type (confirmed or probable) and district of the DRC. A PDF to Excel converter was used to efficiently extract the tables from the situation reports, and the data was collected by week and sorted by geographic location. Because the number of cases is reported as cumulative, spanning from the beginning of the outbreak to the week that the report was released, the cumulative number of cases for one week was subtracted by the cumulative number of cases for the previous week to find the number of new cases for each week.

Release of situation reports for the DRC Ebola outbreak is ongoing, and this data will be updated to reflect newly released situation reports. Currently, the data available reflects situation reports released from August 7, 2018 to January 28, 2020, which exhibit data collected on August 5, 2018 to January 26, 2020. Recent situation reports can be found ([here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/situation-reports)), and reports released before July 23, 2019 can be found ([here](https://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/en/)). As of January 26, 2020, the total number of cumulative cases is 3299 confirmed and 119 probable, reflecting patients reported across 29 health zones in the DRC.
